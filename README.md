# Phonebook
Java program for working with a simple phonebook. Entries in the directory consist of the person's first and last name and their phone number. 
The phone number consists of two parts: the country code and the local number. It is not necessary to perform validity checks on these numbers. 
The following operations have been implemented: adding a new entry to the directory, searching for the phone number of a specified person, 
listing all directory entries in alphabetical order by last name and first name, and storing the directory in the file upon completion of work.
